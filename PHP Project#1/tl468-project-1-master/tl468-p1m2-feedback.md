# Project 1, Milestone 2 Feedback

NetID: tl468

Milestone 2 is graded for a **completion grade _by section_**. This is a feedback milestone. If you tried to complete it, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that section**. If a section is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. **There is no partial credit within a specific section.**

We provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. Our feedback is designed to help you learn more; our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). **Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you get, you are responsible for meeting all of the project's requirements for the final submission.**


**GRADING INSTRUCTIONS:** View the existing website in **Firefox**. View the Design Journey in **Code's Markdown Preview**.


## Planning: Sticky Form
**Target Audience Needs:**
- [] Purpose of form meets the needs of at least 1 target audience.
- [] If form is a contact form (discouraged), a reasonable case made that at least 1 target audience would actually use the contact form.

**Form Restrictions:**
- [] Form is not a search form. Form does not include file uploads.
- [] Form includes at least 4 appropriate form components/controls (not including submit button).
- [] 2 of the controls must be required.

**Form Feedback/Validation**
- [] Includes sketches or thorough descriptions of form design.
- [] Includes sketches or thorough descriptions of form with feedback.
- [] Includes target audience appropriate feedback.
- [] Includes sufficient pseudocode that another 2300 student could implement the validation/feedback of the sticky form..

## Porting Existing Site to PHP
**Dynamic (Server-Side) Website**
- [x] All HTML content resides in PHP files.
- [x] `init.php` is included on the top of every page (does not include partials).
- [x] Website is located in the **root** of the repository (not in subdir).

**Partial Implementation**
- [x] At least 2 partials are implemented (does not include `init.php`).
- [x] All partials reside in the _includes_ folder.
- [x] One partial is used for navigation.
- [x] 2 partials are included on every .php page (partial need not produce visible/rendered HTML).

> What did the student do well?
Great job on starting the partials!

> What needs improvement?
Is there any reason why the main navigation bar is a little bit lower on the page and not on all pages?

## Refined Design: Implementation
**Design**:
- [x] _Design first, then code_ was practiced by the student; coded website is consistent with planned refined design in design journey.
- [x] Design is aesthetically pleasing and employs visual design principles.

**Website**:
- [x] Base website mostly complete with substantial content included (minimal placeholders).
- [x] HTML is well structured and validates (check 1 page).
- [x] Implemented website generally appears to follow best practices (see "Best Practices" in write-up).

> What did the student do well?
The design of the website is really interesting and I like that you were able to start incorporating different design features (colors, fonts, etc) to make your page more aestheically appealing.

> What needs improvement?
Maybe consider the placement of the navigation and see if it would be easy for the user to navigate.

- [x] Citations: Resources are cited according to course policy.
- [x] Has the student made good progress with their project 1?
- [] Student does not have outstanding issues that will severely limit our ability to grade their final submission.
    (i.e. missing files, no images in markdown preview, etc.)

> Does the student appear to be on track? Are you concerned about their progress?
Yes, your work seems to be on track

> Do you have any additional feedback for the student?
The design journey is incomplete and not thorough, so please revisit it.
