## Sticky Form Planning (Milestone 2)

### Sticky Form (Milestone 2)
> What controls do you need for your form?

The controls I needs for my form is Full name, application term, major, GPA, number of credits that have already taken.

> Plan out your feedback messages for your form. You may sketch (probably the easiest) or write it out.

If all controls are typed in correctly (without having wrong types), will printf "Will send your info to your matching colleges and add to their mailist."
else "wrong input~ Be clear! College application needs patience!"

> How does this form meet the needs of at least one of your target audiences (specify which)?

- Meeting the needs of students, who want to get more info from the colleges they have a better chance to get in by calculating their info like #earned credits, application term, etc.
- Meeting the needs of colleges, which wants the contact info of the students they like and who have a great interest on them.

### Validation Code Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write out your pseudocode plan for handling the validation of the form.

```
input $formcontrol from keyboard
$a = $formcontrol
validate $a
htmlspecialchars $a
if ($a fits the requirments) then ok
else print error message
if (all are typed in and all are correct) then {
  1 print successful message
  2 process a BEST MATCH SCHOOL for him from his profile
  3 then send the student's contact info to that college
  }
else print out alert
```

## Complete & Polished Website (Final Submission)

### Target Audiences (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the target audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable by both target audiences.

The final sites changes from a simple static "resources" site for only transfer students -> to a dynamic interaction-based "community: connecting the transfer students group and the colleges that welcome these students.
- For the students, in addition to the resources and assistance provided on the website, they also want to know what colleges is best for them.
- For colleges, they also want to know who are interested in them. Who can join their email interest list and receive information about their application-related and campuslife-related info.

Thus, Thus, Thus!!! From the interestPalette, bulletin, and resources, those colleges could post their infomation to attract students to apply to them. Also, for interestPalette, students could fill up their applicant profile information and sent to the database of the colleges that having a match with him. Then, the college could add him in the database.

### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you havenâ€™t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you havenâ€™t covered in the design journey. You donâ€™t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.

What the interestPaletteWork

- Step#1: Student's info
- Step#2: System checking and validating typed-in info
- Step#3: Error message & beark ------OR--------- Sucessfully message
- Step#4: Matching with colleges (simple algorithm here, could improve in the future)
- Step#5: Print BEST MATCH college based on the student's info
- Step#6: Send the student's email address to College's maillist Database


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from 1300? What things did you have trouble with?

I think this assignment is pretty interesting. I learnt HTML and CSS by myself so I didn't taken 1300. But during our first class, I was super anxious about whether I could do well in the class since I have little hand-on exercise on HTML. However, since this project requires me to first build a whole static website, which help me review many HTML things.

Maybe the timeline is a little tight. :(
