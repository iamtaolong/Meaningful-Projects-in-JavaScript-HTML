# Project 2, Milestone 1 Feedback

NetID: tl468

Milestone 1 is graded for a **completion grade _by section_**. This is a feedback milestone. If you tried to complete it, even though there are some mistakes, you'll get full credit **for that section**. If a section is obviously incomplete, you'll get a 0. **There is no partial credit within a specific section.**

We provide feedback on your milestones to help guide your work for the final submission. Our feedback is designed to help you learn more; our feedback is not a "_pre-grade_". This feedback is designed to catch large problems (which we sometimes miss). **Regardless of the feedback (or lack of feedback) that you get, you are responsible for meeting all of the project's requirements for the final submission.**

_In Milestone 1, you identified your catalog._

## Catalog
- [x] There exists a brief but complete description of catalog.
- [x] Catalog is likely sufficient to complete assignment.
- [ ] Clearly identifies appropriate attributes for catalog.
- [x] Catalog is **not** an image gallery .

> What did the student do well?
Good job brainstorming!

> What needs improvement?
You can't upload images as an attribute in your database. Also, think about redesigning your catalog and removing the button (to see the singers' information) since it might add a lot of complexity to this project.

**Catalog: 5 / 5 points** _(no partial credit)_


## Target Audience
- [x] Clearly explains the target audience(s).
- [x] Catalog choice is appropriate for chosen target audience(s).

> What did the student do well?


> What needs improvement?


**Target Audience: 5 / 5 points** _(no partial credit)_


## Design Patterns
- [x] Clearly identifies examples of existing similar catalogs.
- [x] Clearly explains how the identified design patterns will be leveraged in the design of the catalog for improved usability.


> What did the student do well?


> What needs improvement?
Instead of copying the design of another catalog, think about other ways in which you could modify or improve the existing design.

**Design Patterns: 5 / 5 points** _(no partial credit)_

**Total: 15 / 15 points** (total of sections)
